## Reporting a Vulnerability

jdumpertools doesn't require elevated privileges by default.

As a rule, you should not run jdumpertools on a privileged container or as the superuser; If needed wrap them with a SUDO
rule or limit their access using SELinux.

Please [open a issue](https://github.com/josevnz/jdumpertools/issues) and I will take a look as soon as possible.
